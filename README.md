# Big Brother isnâ€™t Watching You: Crowd Detection and Obfuscation ðŸ‘€

## Introduction
Our project aims to develop a pipeline for Real-Time Image obfuscation from Video Feeds, using state-of-the-art Object Detection Models. We thus explore the possibility of using such a pipeline to implement Crowd Detection and Obfuscation. We accomplish the same by conducting various experiments using a pre-trained Single Shot Multibox Detector model and Facebookâ€™s RetinaNet dense detector. Additionally, we introduce a custom curated and annotated â€™Ashokan Objects in the Wildâ€™ Dataset on objects and places native to Ashoka University. We hence put our models to the test in real Ashokan crowds and conducted various experiments. We provide extensive analyses for the performance of our model in these multiple different scenarios. While we conclude that true Crowd Detection is not feasible with the methods we explore, we believe our experiments have given us valuable insights on the subject.
